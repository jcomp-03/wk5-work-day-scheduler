# Work Day Scheduler (Focus: jQuery, Moment.js, JavaScript)
###### GitHub Pages Deployment: https://jcomp-03.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

The purpose of this week's challenge is to build out a work day scheduler incorporating some jQuery, Moment.js, and JavaScript. Local storage is used so that the schedule information *persists* through webpage refreshes.

  - Implement third-party libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js
  - Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery
  - Use jQuery to save user input in local storage
  - Work with the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML
  - Work with Bootstrap components
  - Add custom color styles to an existing CSS framework
  - Work with custom fonts and icons via a content delivery network (CDN)

Below are a few screenshots which provide visual guide to how the program looks:
